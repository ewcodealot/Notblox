# Three JS Multiplayer Game Demo
not mine!
![Screen](GameScreen1.webp)

## Features

- Multiplayer
- Only TypeScript
- 3D Physics (Rapier.js)
- Vanilla Three.js
- Server Authoritative
- ECS (Entity Component System) with Network Sync (NetworkComponent)
- ~Delta Compression~ (needs rework)
- Interpolation
- Fast to load (small assets)
- Shared code between server and client (useful for component replication)
- Trimesh Collider

 
## Why ?

Browser games are fun, but most of them are Unity WebGL exports that take a long time to load.
I wanted to create a simple multiplayer game engine using Three.js and my own ECS. This project has in mind to be a simple and fast game engine that can be used to create simple multiplayer games with the modularity of ECS.

### Multiplayer GTA-like ?

I'm thinking about creating a GTA-like game with this engine. It would be a simple game with a city, cars, and players. The game would be server-authoritative, and the server would be able to spawn cars, NPCs, and other entities. The game would be a simple sandbox game where players can interact with each other and the environment.

### Online demo

Small demo here : [NotBlox.online](https://www.notblox.online/)

Hosted on an european server, there is no client side prediction, so the game may be laggy if you are far from the server.

### Controls

- W : Forward
- S : Backward
- A : Left
- D : Right
- Space : Jump
- Q : Camera Left
- E : Camera Right

## How to run

### Back-end

Modify the `back/.env` file with `NODE_ENV=development`

```bash
  cd back
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

### Front-end

Uncomment the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` variable in `front/.env.local`, it will default to localhost

```bash
  cd front
  npm install
  npm run dev
```


## Current Event system (might change!)
 
[Is it better design to store event effects within an Entity itself, or within a system?](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/194133/is-it-better-design-to-store-event-effects-within-an-entity-itself-or-within-a)
 >If you are using event queues anyway, you can also do them properly. With one global EventManager system which receives all events. Systems can subscribe to events they are interested in and then the EventManager will put those events into their event queues.


-  `Component` can also be a `NetworkComponent`. This means it can be sent over the network to be replicated by the clients.

### Shared
```js
// Shared component between client & back
export class ColorComponent extends NetworkComponent {
  constructor(entityId: number, public color: string);
  deserialize(data: SerializedColorComponent);
  serialize(): SerializedColorComponent;
}
```

### Back
The back-end need to pass some events; This is achieved with the event components (example: `EventColorComponent`) that are only used once per ECS loop and then removed from the EventQueue entity.

```js
// Creating a color change event on the back
const eventSystem = EventSystem.getInstance();
eventSystem.addEvent(new EventColor(yourEntity.id, "#FFFFFF"));
```
It is then received by its subscribers, here `SyncColorSystem`
```
class EventSystem {
...
this.subscriptions.set(EventColor.name, [new SyncColorSystem()]);
...
}

```
The `ColorComponent` is updated:
```js
export class SyncColorSystem {
  update(entities: Entity[], eventColor: EventColor) {
    const entity = EntityManager.getEntityById(entities, eventColor.entityId);
    if (!entity) return;

    const colorComponent = entity.getComponent(ColorComponent);
    if (!colorComponent) return;

    if (colorComponent && eventColor) {
      colorComponent.color = eventColor.color;
      colorComponent.updated = true; // If this is set to true, the ColorComponent (which is a NetworkComponent) will be broadcasted to the clients
    }
  }
}
```
The `EventColorComponent` is then destroyed by the EventSystem


### Client (front-end)
The component is replicated by the client with the `SyncComponentsSystem.ts`, then it uses the front-end version of `SyncColorSystem` to actually change the color of the mesh, you could incorporate more checks here depending on other components

```js
export class SyncColorSystem {
  update(entities: Entity[]) {
    for (const entity of entities) {
      const colorComponent = entity.getComponent(ColorComponent);
      const meshComponent = entity.getComponent(MeshComponent);
      if (colorComponent && meshComponent && colorComponent.updated) {
        meshComponent.mesh.material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({
          color: colorComponent.color,
        });
      }
    }
  }
}
```
